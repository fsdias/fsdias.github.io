Currently, I’m working as an Auxiliary Researcher at CIBIO/BIOPOLIS.\nMy research centers on examining the effects of human activities and climate change on Mediterranean oak woodlands and associated habitats using advanced mathematical, and statistical approaches.\nI also work as a freelance data analyst for NGOs (e.g. WWF) and (some) private companies. If you have an interesting problem feel free to send me an e-mail (see top right corner).\nI occasionally write on Substack about processing and analysing ecological data."
