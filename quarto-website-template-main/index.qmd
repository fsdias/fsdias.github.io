::: {#about-block}
:::

I am a quantitative ecologist and conservation biologist specializing in using data-driven approaches to address biodiversity conservation problems. Currently, I am an Auxiliary Researcher at CIBIO/BIOPOLIS and am a member of the Theoretical Ecology and Biodiversity Modelling group. I have also spent 10+ years of experience working as a data analyst for ANP/WWF Portugal.

My research focuses on three areas:

1. Understanding the impact of human activities and climate change on the conservation of Mediterranean oak woodlands, as well as the associated habitats such as shrublands and riparian habitats.

2. Applying conceptual, mathematical, and statistical approaches to tackle ecological questions, such as examining the distance decay of community similarity and species abundance distributions.

3. Random projects my colleagues convince me to collaborate on.

In my spare time, I enjoy working out, and birding. I occasionally blog about GIS and statistics (mostly Bayesian).
